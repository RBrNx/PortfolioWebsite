I wanted to create a website that simple to navigate, yet beautiful and engaging, using all my experience and knowledge of web technologies that I have amassed over the past few years.</p><p>The website is made up of a basic HTML template, with <strong>jQuery</strong> doing some of the heavy lifting and some magical <strong>CSS</strong> sprinkled throughout. All of my projects that appear on this website are dynamically loaded using my <strong>Github Profile</strong>, and a JSON file that is stored within each of my repositories, allowing for future projects to be added effortlessly.</p>",
