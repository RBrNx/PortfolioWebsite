I wanted to create a website that simple to navigate, yet beautiful and engaging, using all my experience and knowledge of web technologies that I have amassed over the past few years.</p><p>The website runs using a basic HTML template, with jQuery doing some of the heavy lifting and some magical CSS sprinkled throughout. All of my projects that appear on this website are dynamically loaded using my Github Profile, and a JSON file that is stored within each of my repositories, which means that future projects can be added effortlessly.</p>",
